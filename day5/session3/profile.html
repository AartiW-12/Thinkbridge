        <article id="about">
            <p>I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and frameworks that help me become a more versatile
                developer. I constantly work on improving my debugging skills and understanding how systems interact
                behind the scenes. Working on real-time projects has strengthened my ability to think critically, adapt
                quickly, and deliver reliable results under deadlines. I’m also passionate about writing readable code
                and following industry-standard development practices. As I continue to grow, I look forward to
                contributing to impactful projects and becoming a valuable member of a forward-thinking development
                team.</p>
